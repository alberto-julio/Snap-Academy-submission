Website submission
My first time using github as well as creating a website.
Despite the simple look of the website, I spent a fair amount of time researching and experimenting with different looks of the website.
I was able to learn a great amount about not only github but also about HTML and web development, despite not being fully satisfied with my final product
I enjoyed the process and will continue to learn and experiment with this field!
