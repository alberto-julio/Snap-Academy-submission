        <i>One of my personal favorite items available. This is a different take on traditional korean dishes; Bibimbap which is a mixture of cooked and burnt rice and adds beef bulgolgi; a type of marinated meat. SSAM truly creates a new delicacy that is unlike any other! </i>

        <h2>Cold Noodle:</h2>

        <i>One of SSAM's signature dishes. Ironically named Cold Noodles, it is anything but cold! Noodles are prepared using the hot pots stationed at each table. Vistors are able to add in whatever meats and vegetables they please, delicious! </i>

        <i>Mouth watering pork belly,freshly prepared. Most like it slightly burnt or even slightly raw,however SSAM gives you the option to prepare it however you see fit, yum! </i>
